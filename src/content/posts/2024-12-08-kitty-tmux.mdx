My development stack is [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) on
[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) on [mosh](https://mosh.org/) on
[kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) on [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) on
[Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/).

GNOME, tmux, and Neovim compose a nested set of windows and tabs. Kitty also
provides tabs, but I don't usually use them, since my tmux is remote and kitty's
tabs would be local.

## Problem

I navigate between these layers directionally with these bindings:

- GNOME: `super-hjkl` to switch desktop windows, thanks to the
  [Focus changer](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4627/focus-changer/)
  extension.

- Neovim: `ctrl-hjkl` to switch Vim splits, and `shift-hl` to switch buffer
  tabs. These bindings are from [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/keymaps), as
  a convenient alternative to the longer `ctrl-w hjkl` and `:bn` / `:bN`
  defaults, respectively.

- tmux: `ctrl-a np` to switch windows, and `ctrl-a hjkl` to switch panes.

I'm annoyed by the inefficiency of the three-key sequence to switch
windows in tmux, since it's something that I do a lot, and the other layers have
simpler bindings. I've decided that `super-np` would suit, since that modifier
is never used by TUI apps, because `super` as a modifier doesn't correspond to
any terminal codes.

## Solution

Since `super-n` and `super-p` can't be interpreted directly by terminal
programs, I need kitty to translate them. That looks like this in my
kitty config:

```
# .config/kitty/kitty.conf

map --when-focus-on title:tmux super+p send_text all \x01p
map --when-focus-on title:tmux super+n send_text all \x01n
map --when-focus-on title:tmux super+shift+p send_text all \x01P
map --when-focus-on title:tmux super+shift+n send_text all \x01N
```

When the window title contains `tmux` then map `super-n` to `ctrl-a n` for the
next tab, likewise `p` for the previous tab.

Also map `super-shift-n` and `super-shift-p` to rearrange tabs.

Here's the corresponding config in my tmux config:

```
# .tmux.conf

set -g prefix C-a
unbind C-b
bind C-a send-prefix

bind n next
bind p prev
bind P swap-window -d -t -
bind N swap-window -d -t +

# Default setting with tmux: prepended for kitty to match.
set-option -g set-titles-string "tmux:#S:#I:#W - \"#T\" #{session_alerts}"
set-option -g set-titles on
```

Finally, I had to unbind `super-n` and `super-p` from their default
functions in GNOME, otherwise kitty doesn't receive them. Those functions were
"Focus the current notification" and "Forget everything you know about my
carefully arranged monitors," respectively. I decided I don't need the former
(we'll see if I assign a different key in the future), and _nobody_
wants the latter (it's an unfortunate historical artifact from some Windows
laptop keyboards).

Getting rid of those:

```sh
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.keybindings focus-active-notification '[]'
gsettings set org.gnome.mutter.keybindings switch-monitor '["XF86Display"]'
```

## Bonus

Tangentially, if you want kitty's default binding of `ctrl-shift-u` to show the
[kitty Unicode picker](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/unicode_input/),
you have to kill that GNOME binding, too. You can run `ibus-setup` or this
one-liner:

```sh
dconf write /desktop/ibus/panel/emoji/unicode-hotkey '@as []'
```

Enjoy! âˆ¿
