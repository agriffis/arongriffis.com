Various ways to install things: First, globally with `dnf`; second,
homedir-locally with `mise`; third, homedir-locally with language-specific
installers; fourth, project-locally with `mise`.

This is a quick reference for the third way, using language-specific installers.

In the past, I've configured all third-party tools to install to `~/.local/bin`
but that made it hard to track executables back to their owners, so I've changed
my approach (and this post) to allow third-party tools to install to their
specific dirs.

```bash
export BUN_INSTALL=~/.bun

paths=(
  # Personal overrides first
  ~/bin

  # General third-party install area
  ~/.local/bin

  # Language-specific installs
  "$BUN_INSTALL/bin"
  ~/.cargo/bin
  ~/.cask/bin
  ~/.gem/bin
  ~/.go/bin
  ~/.npm-local/bin
  ~/.yarn/bin

  # System-provided path
  "$PATH"

  # Flatpak launchers for easy access
  /var/lib/flatpak/exports/bin
)

export PATH=$(IFS=:; echo "${path[*]}")
```

Beware that, because this includes `$PATH`, it will accumulate if you run this
sequence separate from profile initialization.

## Node with npm

Install node with `dnf install node` (Fedora) or `brew install node` (macOS).

npm has two installation modes:
[local](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally)
and
[global](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-globally).
Local mode installs in `node_modules` under the current working directory,
especially for projects with dependencies managed by `package.json`. Global
mode normally installs to `/usr` or `/usr/local` which requires sudo, but
you can configure it to install to your home directory instead:

```
✸ npm config set prefix '${HOME}/.npm-local'
```

Installing [prettier](https://prettier.io/), the opinionated code formatter:

```
✸ npm install -g prettier
```

This installs the package in `~/.npm-local/lib/node_modules/prettier` and
creates a symlink at `~/.npm-local/bin/prettier` for running it:

```
✸ which prettier
~/.npm-local/bin/prettier

✸ prettier --version
1.19.1
```

Upgrade with `npm update -g prettier`, and uninstall with `npm uninstall -g
prettier`


## Node with yarn

I'm not sure there's a good reason to use yarn for global installs instead of
npm, but for reference...

After preparing npm above, install yarn with `npm i -g yarn`

yarn has the same local/global modes as npm, and similarly, you can
override the global installation dir:

```
✸ yarn config set prefix '${HOME}/.yarn'
```

Installing [cssunminifier](https://github.com/mrcoles/cssunminifier):

```
✸ yarn global add cssunminifier
```

This installs the package in
`~/.config/yarn/global/node_modules/cssunminifier` but it creates a symlink
in `~/.yarn/bin` according to the configured prefix:

```
✸ which cssunminifier
~/.local/bin/cssunminifier

✸ cssunminifier --version
cssunminifier 0.0.1 (CSS Unminifier) [JavaScript]
```

Upgrade is `yarn global upgrade cssunminifier`, and uninstall is `yarn global
remove cssunminifier`


## Python with pip

Pip accepts `--user` to install to your home directory. On Linux, this defaults
to `~/.local/bin`, and on Mac to `~/Library/Python/3.7/bin`.

It is possible to override this with `PYTHONUSERBASE` and then set `PYTHONPATH`
accordingly, but it's annoying. I've mostly switched to using [mise with
python](https://mise.jdx.dev/lang/python.html), instead.

The following instructions assume you're not using mise, though.

Installing [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), the uncompromising
code formatter:

```
✸ pip install --user black

✸ which black
~/.local/bin/black

✸ black --version
black, version 19.10b0
```

Upgrade is `pip install --user --upgrade` and uninstall is `pip uninstall`
(without `--user`)


## Ruby with gem

gem accepts `--user-install` to install to your home directory. Unfortunately on
Fedora the executable lands in `~/bin` which is my personal scripts area--I'd
rather install packages to `~/.gem/bin`. On Mac the executable lands in
`~/.gem/ruby/2.6.0/bin` which isn't on my `PATH`.

The easy fix is the following line in `~/.gemrc`:

```
gem: --user-install --bindir ~/.gem/bin
```

Installing [rubocop](https://rubocop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), the Ruby
linter:

```
✸ gem install rubocop

✸ which rubocop
~/.gem/bin/rubocop

✸ rubocop --version
0.80.0
```

Upgrade is `gem update rubocop` and uninstall is `gem uninstall rubocop`


## Rust with cargo

Install rust to your home directory with [rustup](https://rustup.rs). You can
also use dnf or brew, but rustup provides a more recent compiler, even nightly
if you want it.

Regardless how Rust is installed, `cargo` installs to `~/.cargo` by default,
with executables in `~/.cargo/bin`.

Installing [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), the really fast
recursive grep:

```
✸ cargo install ripgrep
Installed package `ripgrep v11.0.2` (executable `rg`)

✸ which rg
~/.cargo/bin/rg

✸ rg --version
ripgrep 11.0.2
```


## Go with go install

_This isn't working at the moment._

Go installs in `~/go` by default, but you can keep it out of your visible home
directory by directing it to a different location.

```
✸ go env -w GOPATH=$HOME/.go
```

That writes to `~/.config/go/env` which the go command reads. Alternatively you
can set these in your shell profile--it's up to you.

Installing [elvish](https://elv.sh/), the friendly interactive shell:

```
✸ go install -u github.com/elves/elvish@latest

✸ which elvish
~/.go/bin/elvish

✸ elvish
~> █
```


## Lua with luarocks

Install [luarocks](https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks) on Fedora with `dnf
install luarocks`. The package manager includes configurations for both 5.4
(default) and 5.1 (what we need for NeoVim/LuaJIT compatibility), for example, see
`/etc/luarocks/config-5.1.lua`.

```lua
rocks_trees = {
   { name = "user", root = home .. "/.luarocks" };
   { name = "system", root = "/usr" };
}
lua_interpreter = "lua-5.1";
variables = {
   LUA_DIR = "/usr";
   LUA_BINDIR = "/usr/bin";
}
```

Unfortunately, we need a couple of fixes:

```
sudo ln -s luajit /usr/bin/lua-5.1
luarocks --lua-version=5.4 --local install luarocks-build-rust-mlua
```

And now we can install a required rock for [CopilotChat.nvim](https://github.com/CopilotC-Nvim/CopilotChat.nvim):

```
✸ luarocks --lua-version=5.1 --local install tiktoken_core
```
